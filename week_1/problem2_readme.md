# Problem 2 â€“ Word Search in 2D Matrix

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given a 2D grid of characters and a target word, determine if the word exists in the grid.

- **Simple Version:** Search left-to-right (rows) or top-to-bottom (columns).
- **Extended (LeetCode Version):** Word can be constructed by moving up, down, left, or right (no diagonal, no reuse of same cell).

### âœ… Example

Input:board = [
['F','A','C','I'],
['O','B','Q','P'],
['A','N','O','B'],
['M','A','S','S']
]
word = "FOAM"

Output:true

Explanation: `"FOAM"` appears in the first column â†’ top to bottom.  
`"MASS"` appears in the last row â†’ left to right.

### ðŸ“Œ Approach 1 â€“ Simple Row/Column Search

- Traverse each row and form a string.
- Traverse each column and form a string.
- Check if the word exists.

**Time Complexity:** `O(MÃ—N)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

### ðŸ“Œ Approach 2 â€“ DFS Backtracking (LeetCode Word Search)

- Start DFS from every cell that matches first character.
- Explore 4 neighbors recursively (up, down, left, right).
- Mark cell visited temporarily (`'#'`), backtrack later.
- Return true if full word is matched.

**Time Complexity:** `O(MÃ—NÃ—4^L)` (L = length of word)  
**Space Complexity:** `O(L)` recursion stack
